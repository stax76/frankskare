This page lists projects I've been working on.

StaxRip
-------

StaxRip is a versatile video encoding GUI for Windows. It executes
and controls console apps like x265, NVEnc, mkvmerge, ffmpeg, etc.
and uses the scripting based frameservers, AviSynth+ and VapourSynth,
for video processing.

Because I no longer do video encoding, 2021 my role in the project
changed from active to reserve, meaning in case StaxRip becomes
unmaintained for a longer time, I will maintain it.
